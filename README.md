AnorakPack
==========

AnorakPack is a minecraft modpack for advanced tech based gameplay.

The AnorakPack contains not just a large amount of mods for extensive tech based gameplay but also a collection of modifications to increase realism or just add nice things that make thing more immersive or a general better experience. This can include things like furniture or lighting mods but on the other hand mods that make mobs more dangerous or the environment more dynamic right down to even making ore's spawn more realistically in larger vains to promote exploration and a network of mines.

This modpack uses pakpak (http://github.com/Nekroze/pakpak) to automatically construct a modpack from a simple python script for easier management and a collection of components

Due to the nature and goals of the AnorakPack it is unlikely that it will ever work well for a large public online server and is instead better used either single player, over a LAN or possibly with a small playerbase online. The reason for this is the large number of mods in the AnorakPack which change a great many things by design. To limit the mod count purely to conform to the minority that may play with a large player base online would be damaging to the design of the AnorakPack. That being said every so often the entire mod list will be overviewed to ensure that each and every mod is useful and does not add more complexity (from a performance standpoint) then it is worth.

This pack is currently in a very early stage of development and is intended for purely private use.

TODO
====

 - Make a credits and mods list for all the excelent mod authors
 - Message all mod authors for permissions for 2 person modpack
 - Put more work into Better Ore Distribution configuration files
 - Review if turretmod is unbalancing
 - Ensure ProSthetics mod works with current config changes
 - Find some kind of trading/vending mod
 - Review item transport methods for redundancies
 - Make sure treecapitator works on all appropriate tools
 - Trackdown reason for armor not turning in 3rd person, smartmoving?
 - Investigate Minechem, might be too similar to prosthetics.

Changelog
=========

Due to the highly experimental state of AnorakPack at this point the only changelog will be the git commit history until it becomes stable enough to do a real changelog.

Licensing
=========

I do not own any of the mods referenced by the AnorakPack and am only responsible for making minor compatability adjustments to the configuration files stored here.
