AnorakPack
==========

AnorakPack is a minecraft modpack for advanced tech based gameplay.

This modpack uses pakpak (http://github.com/Nekroze/pakpak) to automatically construct a modpack from a simple python script for easier management and a collection of components

This pack is currently in a very early stage of development and is intended for purely private use.
