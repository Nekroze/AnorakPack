AnorakPack
==========

AnorakPack is a minecraft modpack for advanced tech based gameplay.

This modpack uses pakpak (http://github.com/Nekroze/pakpak) to automatically construct a modpack from a simple python script for easier management and a collection of components

This pack is currently in a very early stage of development and is intended for purely private use.

Changelog
=========

Due to the highly experimental state of AnorakPack at this point the only changelog will be the git commit history until it becomes stable enough to do a real changelog.

Licensing
=========

I do not own any of the mods referenced by the AnorakPack and am only responsible for making minor compatability adjustments to the configuration files stored here.
