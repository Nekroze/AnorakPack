AnorakPack
==========

AnorakPack is a minecraft modpack for advanced tech based gameplay.

This modpack uses pakpak (http://github.com/Nekroze/pakpak) to automatically construct a modpack from a simple python script for easier management and a collection of components

This pack is currently in a very early stage of development and is intended for purely private use.

TODO
====

 - Make a credits and mods list for all the excelent mod authors
 - Message all mod authors for permissions for 2 person modpack
 - Put more work into Better Ore Distribution configuration files
 - Review if turretmod is unbalancing
 - Ensure ProSthetics mod works with current config changes
 - Find some kind of trading/vending mod
 - Review item transport methods for redundencies
 - See if MultiMine can work on tree's with treecapitator
 - Make sure treecapitator works on all appropriate tools

Changelog
=========

Due to the highly experimental state of AnorakPack at this point the only changelog will be the git commit history until it becomes stable enough to do a real changelog.

Licensing
=========

I do not own any of the mods referenced by the AnorakPack and am only responsible for making minor compatability adjustments to the configuration files stored here.
